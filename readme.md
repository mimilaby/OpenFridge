## What is this

This is a domestic food management app, keeping track of your food amount
and expiery date, to offer you meal advice and try avoid wasting food.

## Why this

This project will be focusing on reducing the waste of food at home.
Statistics shows that around **30% of all food** produced each year is wasted,
which worth approximately **US$ 1 trillion**.

There are exsisting apps with the same goal:
 [NoWaste](https://www.nowasteapp.com),
 [grocy](https://github.com/grocy/grocy) etc.
 They are good products. But I wish an open-source, user-focused,
  up-to-date app. This is why.

- Use open databases
